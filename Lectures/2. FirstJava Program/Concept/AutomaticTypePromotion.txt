Automatic Type Promotion in Java

Definition: Automatic type promotion in Java occurs when performing operations on mixed data types.
The Java compiler promotes smaller data types to larger data types to prevent data loss
and ensure that operations are performed accurately.

Rules for Automatic Type Promotion
1. Byte, Short, and Char: When a byte, short, or char is used in an arithmetic operation,
it is automatically promoted to an int before the operation.

2. Mixed Types: If different types of variables are used in an operation, all variables
are converted to the largest data type used in the operation.

Code Explanation:

Arithmetic Operations:
1. (floatValue * byteValue): The byte value byteValue is promoted to float because floatValue is a float.
The result of the multiplication is a float.

2. (intValue / charValue): The char value charValue is promoted to int because intValue is an int.
The result of the division is an int.

3. (doubleValue * shortValue): The short value shortValue is promoted to double because doubleValue is a double.
The result of the multiplication is a double.

Type Promotion in Expressions:
The results of these operations are combined in the final expression. The resulting types are promoted to the
largest type present in the expression, which is double.
